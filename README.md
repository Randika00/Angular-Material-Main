## Angular-Material-Main-Typography

Angular Material represents a theme as a Sass map that contains your color, typography, and density choices, as well as some base design system settings.
For developers using AngularJS, Angular Material is both a UI Component framework and a reference implementation of Google's Material Design Specification. 
This project provides a set of reusable, well-tested, and accessible UI components based on Material Design.

This project is a comprehensive and efficient platform developed using the Angular framework alongside TypeScript, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Created and 
managed with Visual Studio Code (VS Code), this system is designed to streamline the process of user registration and account management, offering a user-friendly 
interface and robust functionality.
